# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished till "Nest an anchor element within a paragraph" in the HTML5 & CSS section

**Thoughts:** This part was a breeze considering I already know html basics and CSS. Waiting to see what's different with HTML5.

### Day 1: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Use an id attribute to style an element"


**Thoughts:** Discovered the "required" tag for client side validation, wasn't there when I last touched html but found it super useful. It will be interesting to see as we progress whether they also talk about security.

### Day 2: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished HTML5 & CSS

**Thoughts:** Most HTML was familiar and wasn't sure what was new about HTML5. CSS was familiar and was a quick revision.

### Day 5: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built the tribute page

**Thoughts:** It was relatively simple to get the content (not original content yet) and structure in place. The styling still needs work.

### Day 6: June 13, 2017 (took a break yesterday)

**Today's Progress**: Started with the portfolio page project. Wrapped my head around what needs to be done. Took time to break it down to smaller tasks and finished one task in its rudimentary form.

**Thoughts:** This task seems really daunting. Getting the page structure in place is a relatively easy task (being a backend developer all these years). The styling is the hard part.

### Day 9: June 16, 2017 (took a break)

### Day 10: June 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added background to the navbar and got the box shadow as per viewing position

**Thoughts:** No good tutorials for CSS. All tutorials are either too basic or  assume you know the basics. Or it is just a different style of writing I need to get used to.
