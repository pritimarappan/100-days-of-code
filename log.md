# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished till "Nest an anchor element within a paragraph" in the HTML5 & CSS section

**Thoughts:** This part was a breeze considering I already know html basics and CSS. Waiting to see what's different with HTML5.

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Use an id attribute to style an element"


**Thoughts:** Discovered the "required" tag for client side validation, wasn't there when I last touched html but found it super useful. It will be interesting to see as we progress whether they also talk about security.
